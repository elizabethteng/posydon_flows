Using normalizing flows to accelerate BBH likelihood estimation with POSYDON


“Accelerate the likelihood estimation of forming a BBH of given properties”

Given a POSYDON model, accelerate the estimation of the likelihood of forming a BBH of given properties. Use as a benchmark a KDE estimation fo the likelihood. As an extension, interpolate the likelihood estimates between POSYDON models of different hyperparameters
